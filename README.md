## User Story

As a developer I wanted an app which would quickly let me create a professional Readme for a project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When prompted for information about the application repository, a professional Readme is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
- When a title for the project is entered, then it is dispalyed as the Title of the Readme.
- When a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered, the information is appended to the relevant sections of the file.
- When choosing a license for my application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License.
- When I enter my GitHub username, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
- When I enter my email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
- When a link is clicked in the Table of Contents, then we are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
